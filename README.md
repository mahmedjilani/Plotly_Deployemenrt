The goal of this analysis is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis includes three charts: a bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.
